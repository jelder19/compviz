Histogram of oriented Gradients (HoG) is a technique used for object detection. HoG divides an image into a distribution of gradients. These are called cells, and each cell creates a histogram for the pixels within that region which represents an overall descriptor. OpenCV has a HoG class called HOGDescriptor. Particularly, HOGDescriptor has a built in detector called getDefaultPeopleDetector.
