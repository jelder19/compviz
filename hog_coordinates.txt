The Viola-Jones detection algorithm is commonly used in facial recognition/tracking. It examines groups of pixels based on complex feature types, and decreases the effect of false-positive identifications through the use of cascading. This algorithm is implemented in openCV (as cvHaarDetectObjects() ) and the cascading effect is also easily achieved using other built-in openCV methods.
